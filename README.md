# One-Last-Wish
Source code for the game One Last Wish.
Made in Godot Engine 3.1
The SMRT Dialogue (by BrunoSXS) plugin files are all in the 'addons' folder. Some of the files have been tweaked by me to fit better into the game and make writing the dialogue files easier. 

Terrible, rushed code in all its glory.
You can find the game here:
